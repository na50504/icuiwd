# HTML Beginner Project
 This is my first web development project for ICUIWD.
 I used HTML to create a basic website with a heading, paragraph, and examples from topics like:

  - HTML Colors 
  - HTML Style 
  - HTML Quotations 
  
  I created this using Visual Studio Code and will push it to GitHub.
